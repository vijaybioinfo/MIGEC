# MIGEC
In-house developed pipeline for bulk TCR data preprocessing based on the Molecular Identifier-Guided Error Correction (MIGEC) tool.\
MIGEC was [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2960) and maintained by [Dr. Mikhail Shugay](https://github.com/mikessh). Our in-house pipeline was intended to help process the data from hundreds or even couples of thousands of bulk TCR libraries in an efficient manner.\
